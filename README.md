# 1-st *SSRF Whitelist Filter Bypass*
A `whitelist` filter is a security mechanism used to restrict access to certain resources or functionalities based on predefined criteria. In the context of `SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)` mitigation, a whitelist filter specifically involves allowing only pre-approved URLs or IP addresses to be accessed by the server. 

# 2-nd *Bypassing IP Address Blacklists*
In `SSRF`, IP address blacklisting involves blocking requests from specific IP addresses known for malicious `SSRF` activities. This reactive measure adds identified IPs to a blacklist, preventing their access to mitigate further exploitation attempts.

# 3-rd *Subdomain Evasion*
in `SSRF`,  subdomain evasion involves exploiting the vulnerability to bypass security controls or restrictions by targeting subdomains instead of the main domain. Attackers might craft `SSRF` requests to access internal resources or external endpoints by using subdomains that are not subject to the same level of scrutiny or filtering as the primary domain. 

# 4-th *Malformed URL Tricks*
in `SSRF`, malformed URL tricks involve manipulating URL parameters or structures to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications or network systems. Attackers craft URLs with altered components, such as protocols, domains, paths, or parameters, to deceive servers into making unintended requests.

# 5-th *Decimal IP Wizardry*
Decimal IP wizardry in `SSRF` refers to a technique where attackers leverage decimal representations of IP addresses to bypass security controls or exploit vulnerabilities in web applications or network systems. Instead of using the conventional dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1), attackers represent IP addresses in their decimal form (e.g., 3232235777 for 192.168.1.1).
